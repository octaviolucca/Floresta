//! A port of [`SocketAddr`](std::net::SocketAddr) that also supports non-ip based addresses, such as Onion and I2P.
//!
//! Inside floresta-wire, we rely heavily on passing addresses around, including several API-facing
//! methods. Each address might be one of several different types, such as IP address, I2P, Onion
//! or a domain that must be resolved. [`AddrV2`] wraps most of those — with the exception of
//! Domain. However, we still need a port to connect with those addresses, and [`AddrV2`] is only
//! the address part. To avoid passing ports as arguments every time, and remove duplicate address
//! parsing logic, we have this [`BitcoinSocketAddr`] struct.
//!
//! It contains an inner [`AddrV2`] address and a [`u16`] port, a parsing logic for all supported
//! addresses, including optional DNS resolving.
//!
//! The DNS part is handled by an implementation of the [`DnsResolver`] trait, by default we use
//! the [`SystemResolver`] implementation, that uses the OS resolver. If you prefer, you can bring
//! your own resolver.
